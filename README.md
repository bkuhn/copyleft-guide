This repository contains various tutorial materials regarding the suite of GNU General
Public Licenses and copyleft (as applied to software).

The primary item of interest is an omnibus book on copyleft that is built
from the comprehensive-GPL-guide.tex file.

You can build this project with the following command:

    $ make

You may need to first install texlive, tex4ht and a few other things.  On
Debian-based systems, this command may work as root:

    # aptitude install texlive-full make tex4ht
